#Pypplets main


= Project Status =

The initial commit was made today (09/09/2009)

The status is pre-alpha, that means not much is tested so you
*run this code under your own risk*. 

The project can be built using SCons, just run scons in the project
folder and it will generate a libpypplets.so. You may place this file 
under ~/.mozilla/plugins to make it available to your browser. 

Currently, it only executes Python scripts, so not many exciting things
will currently happen. I will post soon enough a test page with a Pypplet 
embedded.
